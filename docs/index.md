# Mirador Core — Documentation

Welcome to the Mirador Core documentation. This site has been simplified to focus on the four core topics that drive the project: Unified Query, KPI, Correlation, and RCA. These pages are short, practical, and intended to give readers a concise, usable reference.

## Who this is for

- Platform engineers maintaining Mirador Core
- Developers integrating with Mirador's Unified Query API
- Observability engineers who configure KPI discovery and RCA pipelines

If you need deeper operational runbooks or long-form guides that were present previously, those legacy pages are still available in the repository but are intentionally not included in the main documentation navigation.

If you'd like a different structure (for example a short getting-started, architecture, or migration pages in the main TOC), tell me and I will update the index and the four pages accordingly.
