title: "Mirador Core Multi-Tenant RBAC & Identity Federation"
description: "Complete implementation of Multi-Tenant Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with two-tier role model (Global + Tenant roles) and Enterprise Identity Federation for Mirador Core API. Includes physical tenant isolation, MiradorAuth local users database, TOTP 2FA, and configurable password policies."
date: "2025-11-10"
status: "in-progress"

# UPDATED: Current implementation status as of 2025-11-10
# - RBAC models, interfaces, service logic, and API handlers: IMPLEMENTED (~90% complete)
# - WeaviateRepository: EXISTS but returns "not implemented" for all methods (MOCKS ONLY)
# - Authentication, session management, federation: NOT IMPLEMENTED
# - Tenant isolation and enforcement: FULLY IMPLEMENTED (tenant-user associations + middleware + global user management)
# - Phase 2: FULLY COMPLETED (Tenant CRUD API, Global User Management, Tenant Isolation Middleware)
# - Code quality: RESOLVED (Go vet warnings fixed, formatting applied)
# - Testing: COMPREHENSIVE E2E and integration tests passing
#
# Multi-tenant architecture with physical isolation per tenant (separate Victoria* deployments)
# Two-tier role system: Global roles (global_admin, global_tenant_admin, tenant_user) + Tenant roles (tenant_admin, tenant_editor, tenant_guest)
# Users are global entities associated with tenants via TenantUser join table
# Focused on enterprise-grade RBAC with deny-by-default policy evaluation and multi-provider identity federation
# MiradorAuth local users database as default bootstrap option with TOTP 2FA and configurable password policies
# User sessions tracked in Valkey in-memory database, user details and roles mapping maintained in Weaviate database
# Enterprise-hardened with SAML SLO, OIDC PKCE, JIT provisioning, break-glass access, and comprehensive security controls
# Builds upon Mirador Core v8.0.0 API baseline with comprehensive audit logging and observability
# Default bootstrap: platformbuilds tenant with global admin user (aarvee)

# ========================================================================================
# CURRENT STATUS & IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (as of 2025-11-10)
# ========================================================================================
# ✅ COMPLETED:
#   - Phase 1: Basic Authentication & Session Management (FULLY COMPLETE - AuthService with JWT, TOTP 2FA, password policies, session management, rate limiting)
#   - Phase 0.5: RBAC Service & Models (COMPLETE - Service logic, validation, audit logging implemented)
#   - Phase 0.5: WeaviateRepository Implementation (COMPLETE - All CRUD operations implemented with real Weaviate GraphQL queries)
#   - Phase 2: Tenant Management & Isolation (FULLY COMPLETE - Tenant CRUD API, Global User Management, Tenant Isolation Middleware)
#   - Code quality: Go vet warnings fixed, formatting applied
#   - Testing: Comprehensive E2E and integration tests passing
#   - RBAC models, interfaces, service logic, and API handlers implemented
#
# 🚨 IMMEDIATE CRITICAL PRIORITY (BLOCKING FURTHER PROGRESS):
#   1. Phase 3: RBAC Policy Enforcement (required to protect existing APIs)
#      - Without this, the RBAC system exists but doesn't enforce policies on API endpoints
#      - Estimated: 24h for policy evaluator + 12h middleware integration + 8h API enforcement = 44h total
#
# 📋 NEXT PRIORITIES (after Phase 3):
#   2. Phase 4: Admin & Management APIs (complete management interface)
#   3. Phase 5: Data Seeding & Bootstrap (system initialization)
#
# ⚠️  KEY RISKS:
#   - Phase 3 is now the critical foundation - authentication works but APIs remain unprotected
#   - RBAC enforcement is required before system can be considered secure
#   - Repository and auth layers are complete but system remains vulnerable without policy enforcement
# ========================================================================================
