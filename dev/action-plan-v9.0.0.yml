title: "Mirador Core Multi-Tenant RBAC & Identity Federation"
description: "Complete implementation of Multi-Tenant Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with two-tier role model (Global + Tenant roles) and Enterprise Identity Federation for Mirador Core API. Includes physical tenant isolation, MiradorAuth local users database, TOTP 2FA, and configurable password policies."
date: "2025-11-08"
status: "planning"

# Multi-tenant architecture with physical isolation per tenant (separate Victoria* deployments)
# Two-tier role system: Global roles (global_admin, global_tenant_admin, tenant_user) + Tenant roles (tenant_admin, tenant_editor, tenant_guest)
# Users are global entities associated with tenants via TenantUser join table
# Focused on enterprise-grade RBAC with deny-by-default policy evaluation and multi-provider identity federation
# MiradorAuth local users database as default bootstrap option with TOTP 2FA and configurable password policies
# User sessions tracked in Valkey in-memory database, user details and roles mapping maintained in Weaviate database
# Enterprise-hardened with SAML SLO, OIDC PKCE, JIT provisioning, break-glass access, and comprehensive security controls
# Builds upon Mirador Core v8.0.0 API baseline with comprehensive audit logging and observability
# Default bootstrap: platformbuilds tenant with global admin user (aarvee)
