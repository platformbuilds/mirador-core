date: "2025-11-10"
status: "in-progress"

# UPDATED: Current implementation status as of 2025-11-14 - POST ASSESSMENT & NEW E2E SCRIPT

# - Phase 0-4: FULLY COMPLETED (2025-11-13)
#   * Phase 0: Schema Design - All 12 Weaviate RBAC classes designed
#   * Phase 0.5: Repository Implementation - WeaviateRBACRepository (40+ CRUD operations, 5 files, 3450+ LOC)
#   * Phase 1: Authentication - AuthService with JWT, local auth, session management, TOTP 2FA
#   * Phase 2: Tenant Management - Tenant/User/TenantUser CRUD APIs, TenantIsolationMiddleware
#   * Phase 3: RBAC Enforcement - PolicyCache, RBACEnforcer middleware, two-tier role evaluation
#   * Phase 4: Admin APIs - Complete RBAC management (7 handlers, 20+ endpoints)
# - Phase 5: BOOTSTRAP VALIDATION - 90% COMPLETE (2025-11-14)
#   ✅ Bootstrap service implemented with idempotency (470+ LOC)
#   ✅ Bootstrap tool (cmd/bootstrap/main.go) - standalone CLI tool
#   ✅ Schema deployment script (scripts/deploy-rbac-schema.sh)
#   ✅ Unit tests with comprehensive coverage (rbac_bootstrap_test.go)
#   ✅ Server integration (runs on startup)
#   ✅ Documentation in README.md
#   ✅ NEW: Comprehensive E2E validation script (e2e-tests-new.sh) with bootstrap testing
#   ❌ E2E validation with real Weaviate/Valkey infrastructure NOT TESTED (requires running script)
#   ❌ Comprehensive bootstrap validation tests missing (covered by new E2E script)
# - Code quality: RESOLVED (Go vet warnings fixed, formatting applied)
# - Testing: Bootstrap unit tests complete, E2E integration tests now available via new script
# - Federation: PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY (SAML/OIDC middleware stubs exist but non-functional)
#
# Multi-tenant architecture with physical isolation per tenant (separate Victoria* deployments)
# Two-tier role system: Global roles (global_admin, global_tenant_admin, tenant_user) + Tenant roles (tenant_admin, tenant_editor, tenant_guest)
# Users are global entities associated with tenants via TenantUser join table
# Focused on enterprise-grade RBAC with deny-by-default policy evaluation and multi-provider identity federation
# MiradorAuth local users database as default bootstrap option with TOTP 2FA and configurable password policies
# User sessions tracked in Valkey in-memory database, user details and roles mapping maintained in Weaviate database
# Enterprise-hardened with SAML SLO, OIDC PKCE, JIT provisioning, break-glass access, and comprehensive security controls
# Builds upon Mirador Core v8.0.0 API baseline with comprehensive audit logging and observability
# Default bootstrap: platformbuilds tenant with global admin user (aarvee)

# ========================================================================================
# CURRENT STATUS & IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (as of 2025-11-14 - UPDATED ASSESSMENT)
# ========================================================================================
# ✅ FULLY COMPLETED PHASES:
#   - Phase 0 (Schema Design): ALL 12 Weaviate RBAC classes designed (Tenant, User, TenantUser, MiradorAuth, 
#     AuthConfig, Role, Permission, Group, RoleBinding, GroupBinding, AuditLog)
#   - Phase 0.5 (Repository Implementation): WeaviateRBACRepository with 40+ CRUD operations (5 Go files, 3450+ LOC)
#   - Phase 1 (Authentication): AuthService with JWT, local auth, session management, TOTP 2FA, password policies
#   - Phase 2 (Tenant Management): Tenant/User/TenantUser CRUD APIs, TenantIsolationMiddleware, global user management
#   - Phase 3 (RBAC Enforcement): PolicyCache, RBACEnforcer middleware, two-tier role evaluation, API protection
#   - Phase 4 (Admin APIs): Complete RBAC management (7 handler files: rbac, auth, mirador_auth, auth_config, 
#     rbac_audit, tenant, user handlers with 20+ endpoints)
#   - Bootstrap Service: RBACBootstrapService implemented (470+ LOC) with default tenant, admin user, roles seeding
#   - Server Integration: Bootstrap runs on server startup, all handlers registered, middleware chain active
#
# 📊 IMPLEMENTATION METRICS (as of 2025-11-14):
#   - Repository Layer: 5 non-test Go files in internal/repo/rbac (interfaces, weaviate, valkey, service, audit)
#   - Handler Layer: 7 RBAC-related handlers (rbac, auth, mirador_auth, auth_config, rbac_audit, tenant, user)
#   - Middleware Layer: 2 files (rbac.middleware.go, auth_rbac.middleware.go)
#   - Models: Complete RBAC models (Tenant, User, TenantUser, Role, Permission, Group, RoleBinding, etc.)
#   - Code Quality: Only 1 TODO marker found (in test file), Go vet clean, formatting applied
#   - Test Coverage: Basic E2E tests passing (Oct 25), comprehensive E2E script now available (e2e-tests-new.sh)
#
# 🚨 IMMEDIATE CRITICAL PRIORITY (BLOCKING PRODUCTION):
#   1. Phase 5: Data Seeding & Bootstrap E2E Validation (CRITICAL - 4-6h)
#      ACTION ITEMS:
#      a) ✅ COMPLETED: Created comprehensive E2E validation script (e2e-tests-new.sh)
#      b) Use `make localdev-up` to start Weaviate + Valkey stack, then run `./localtesting/e2e-tests-new.sh`
#      c) Validate bootstrap idempotency (multiple runs should not fail/duplicate)
#      d) Test bootstrap error handling and recovery (Weaviate down, Valkey down, etc.)
#      e) Document bootstrap process and default credentials in README/docs
#
#   2. Phase 6: Integration & E2E Testing (HIGH - 8-12h)
#      ACTION ITEMS:
#      a) End-to-end authentication flow testing (covered by new E2E script)
#      b) RBAC enforcement validation on protected endpoints (covered by new E2E script)
#      c) Multi-tenant isolation testing (covered by new E2E script)
#      d) Policy cache validation (cache hit/miss, TTL, invalidation on policy changes)
#      e) Tenant provisioning integration (automatic Victoria* cluster provisioning)
#      f) Load testing with concurrent users, multiple tenants, policy evaluation performance
#      g) Security testing (attempt privilege escalation, cross-tenant access, session hijacking)
#
#   3. Phase 7: Enterprise Federation (MEDIUM - 20-24h)
#      ACTION ITEMS (scope update 2025-11-14):
#      a) LDAP/AD integration (user sync, group mapping, authentication) — IN SCOPE
#      b) SAML/OIDC flows deferred until post-LDAP milestone
#      c) JIT provisioning deferred with SAML/OIDC
#      d) Federation configuration API TBD after LDAP delivery
#      e) Break-glass emergency access mechanism remains in planning backlog
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL GAPS & RISKS:
#   - Bootstrap validation: NOT YET TESTED end-to-end with real Weaviate/Valkey (new E2E script ready to run)
#   - Weaviate schema deployment: Schema classes may not exist in Weaviate (need schemactl or manual creation)
#   - Policy enforcement: Needs comprehensive testing with real user scenarios (covered by new E2E script)
#   - Federation: NOT IMPLEMENTED (SAML/OIDC/LDAP endpoints are placeholders)
#   - Performance: Policy evaluation performance under load unknown
#   - Security audit: No formal security review or penetration testing conducted
#   - Documentation: Limited end-user documentation for RBAC setup and usage
#
# 📈 PRIORITY RANKING (Next 4 Weeks):
#   WEEK 1: Phase 5 Bootstrap Validation + Run New E2E Tests (CRITICAL - BLOCKING)
#   WEEK 2: Phase 6 Integration Testing + Security Testing (HIGH)
#   WEEK 3: Phase 6 Performance Testing + Policy Cache Optimization (MEDIUM)
#   WEEK 4: Phase 7 Federation (SAML/OIDC) + Documentation (MEDIUM)
#
# 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 5 (NEXT MILESTONE):
#   - ✅ Bootstrap runs successfully on clean Weaviate/Valkey instances
#   - ✅ Default tenant "PLATFORMBUILDS" created with correct metadata
#   - ✅ Global admin user "aarvee" created with correct global_role
#   - ✅ Tenant-user association created linking admin to tenant
#   - ✅ MiradorAuth credentials created with secure default password
#   - ✅ 4 default roles created (global_admin, tenant_admin, tenant_editor, tenant_guest)
#   - ✅ Bootstrap idempotency verified (can run multiple times without errors)
#   - ✅ Bootstrap error handling tested (graceful degradation on failures)
